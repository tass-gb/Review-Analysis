To my surprise, my refund was declined on the grounds that the item had been worn.

After pushing further, a supervisor eventually agreed to a refund and advised me to dispose of the trousers ‚Äî but before I could save the conversation, the chat system disconnected. I received no confirmation email about the refund.

As a result, I had to re-enter the chat and repeat the entire story, which left me feeling frustrated and anxious. Eventually, I was referred to a manager, who unfortunately was quite dismissive and unsympathetic. Although the manager initially confirmed the refund, the chat was abruptly ended after I provided feedback,  and I was again informed that the refund had been declined.

This entire experience has been incredibly disappointing. The fact that I received what appears to be a used item in the first place raises serious concerns about your quality control processes. On top of that, the lack of a proper escalation or email support system, combined with inconsistent and unsupportive customer service, made me feel like I was pleading for fairness ‚Äî despite being completely honest and reasonable in my request.

After this experience, I cannot see myself shopping with ASOS again. I hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made both in their returns inspection processes and in the quality of their customer service.

‚≠ê (1/5 stars)

I am beyond frustrated with ASOS and their complete failure to deliver both products and customer service. This has been hands down the worst online shopping experience I've ever encountered.

**The Delivery Nightmare:**
Their delivery company claimed THREE separate delivery attempts with ""no access"" to my property. This is completely fabricated. I live in a standard house - not an apartment building, no gates, no construction, nothing blocking access. I was home ALL DAY on each supposed delivery attempt, watching for the delivery. No one came. No delivery attempts were made. No cards were left. Nothing.

**Customer Service That Doesn't Exist:**
When I contacted ASOS about this obvious lie from their delivery partner, their customer service was absolutely useless. Despite requesting to speak with a live agent multiple times, I received nothing but the same copy-and-paste responses over and over again. They clearly don't read messages or care about resolving issues - just robotic, scripted responses that completely ignore the actual problem.

**The Delivery Company is Unreachable:**
The delivery company provides zero ways to contact them. No phone number, no email, and even their AI chat assistant is completely non-functional. How is this acceptable in 2025? When there's clearly an issue with delivery, customers should have some recourse.

**Complete Lack of Accountability:**
ASOS takes no responsibility for their chosen delivery partners' failures. They hide behind ""delivery partner policies"" while taking your money and failing to deliver the service you paid for.

I've wasted hours trying to resolve this simple delivery issue, only to be met with lies, automated responses, and complete indifference. My order is now in limbo, I'm out the money, and ASOS couldn't care less.

Save yourself the headache and shop literally anywhere else. ASOS has clearly given up on customer service entirely. There are plenty of other online retailers who actually care about getting your purchases to you and resolving issues when they arise.

68b470d949e122dc24ecbe09,False,False,"I have now had at least 8 chats and email conversations with ASOS customer service about the same issue. The problem started with technical errors on the website during payment: for example, I select iDeal, but I get redirected to a PayPal page. After that, I receive an error message, the items appear as ordered, but then they get cancelled automatically.

Instead of acknowledging this as a technical issue on the ASOS website, I was taken through long troubleshooting steps that led nowhere, with vague advice like ‚Äúcontact your bank.‚Äù That makes no sense ‚Äì what does my bank have to do with being redirected from iDeal to PayPal? This is clearly a fault on ASOS‚Äôs side.

This problem has occurred repeatedly, I have given feedback multiple times, yet nothing is solved. The website is misleading because it promises one payment method but forces another, and then cancels the order. Meanwhile, ASOS refuses to provide me with the legally required contact details of the legal disputes/complaints team, despite me asking for them in every conversation. Instead, I am told to wait 24‚Äì48 hours for a manager ‚Äì which is not a lawful substitute.

According to the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU, Article 6) and the UK Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, ASOS is required to provide consumers with clear and accessible information and to refrain from misleading or unfair practices. ASOS is failing on both points.

I therefore expect:
	‚Ä¢	Compensation for the time I wasted because of ASOS‚Äôs misleading website and repeated failed orders.
	‚Ä¢	Immediate shipment of my cancelled items or a proper replacement solution.
	‚Ä¢	The direct contact details of the legal disputes/complaints team, as required by law.

I ordered a product as a gift and paid for premium next-day delivery on 23rd for a birthday on the 24th.

The delivery window is stated as 7am - 10pm

At 21:45 I used the DPD tracking service and could see the parcel was at one of their warehouses - more than a hour's drive away.

I contacted ASOS online and that's when the fun started: In summary I was told:
1. Wait until the end of the day/night - notwithstanding the delivery window is until 10pm. I emphasised this to three support agents over the span of a couple hours. They clearly seemed to be unable to comprehend the fact that the order was already late.

2. I should always allow a couple extra days for delivery delays - why on earth does ASOS offer, and take money, for guaranteed next-day delivery if they are not confident it can happen. NOTE - my frustration  has nothing to do with the ¬£7 premium delivery fee! This was offered as a refund but my issue with the absolute ineptitude of the 'customer support' - not the delivery fee refund!

3. The issue is with the carrier not ASOS....CORRECTION, I contracted with, and paid ASOS. ASOS appoints logistics service providers to fulfill their comittments. The responsibility rests with ASOS to ensure service standards are maintained. It is NOT my responsibility to chase 3rd party service providers.

4. One of the agents (Emily) 'exited the chat' when I kept emphasising that the delivery was already late, after being told to wait another day.

5. When I logged on to the¬†DPD chat bot facility the response was to get ASOS to raise a 'parcel search' (as it may be displaced in the warehouse). I requested this of the last agent I engaged with. He told me that he had contacted DPD and was told that it would be delivered the next day. When I asked HOW he contacted them he couldn't tell me - he blatantly lied!

The strategy that the agents adopted was to defer the conversation by telling the customer to be patient and wait another day so that they did not have to deal with the matter properly.

Instead of telling me to be patient, wait another day and then raise a concern, plan ahead better etc etc all one of them needed to say was 'we are terribly sorry about the inconvenience and your frustration. I have attempted to contact DPD with no response but I will continue trying to do so and will contact you with an update when I receive one' but no, make it the customer's issue and defer the problem so that they don't need to deal with it.

I recently purchased a pair of New Balance 327 trainers in black from ASOS. While initially very happy with their comfort, I was soon disappointed when they developed a loud, squeaking noise after just a few days of wear. The sound was extremely conspicuous, drawing unwanted attention and making me feel too self-conscious to wear them.

Attempting to resolve this, I contacted ASOS customer service. I was informed that, as it was a 'partner item', I would have to contact New Balance directly to arrange a return. Upon contacting New Balance, I was told the opposite‚Äîthat I needed to go through ASOS, as they were the retailer. This frustrating cycle is a common tactic where neither party seems willing to take responsibility after they have made a sale.

After persistent effort, I finally managed to speak to a human at ASOS who was very helpful and promised to email a returns label within three days. The label never arrived. As a non-UK resident with a scheduled flight, I was forced to leave the country with the faulty shoes, unable to return them in time.

Now based in Thailand, I contacted ASOS again. Their response was is that had 28 days from the purchase date to return the item, ignoring my specific query about an international return. When I investigated shipping from Thailand myself, I was quoted a minimum of ¬£75, with no guarantee the return would be processed in time.

I ordered something at ASOS. The delivery company did not deliver it to my address, and the package was lost for a long time. In the meantime, I spoke with ASOS, and they said they would start an investigation and get me my money back. For a while, I never heard from them again. About a month later, I eventually received the package from someone who said she was the realtor from one of the vacant apartments, and she found it on the balcony of this house. The delivery company just threw the package on the balcony instead of delivering it to my house.

Before I could even speak to someone at customer care, the chat started over again three times. All these times, I was in the middle of a conversation. The last time I finally had a conversation, which eventually lasted 1,5 hours because they replied in bad English and very slowly, which resulted in the answer: ""We can not help you any further because the time window of the return policy had been surpassed"". I said that the time window does not apply in a situation where you did not receive the package in time, but the only answer I got, multiple times, was that they couldn't help me any further. 

At this point, I am stuck with a package filled with clothes that I sadly do not fit, or are of poor quality, and I will not get my money back, even though I am not at fault in this situation. They also did not investigate the situation any further or submit a request for reimbursement of costs to the delivery company. They just DO NOT help you.

When I re-opened the review to edit it and re-submit, there was no button to press submit, despite them saying I could re-submit in their email. How convenient for them. That‚Äôs why I decided to come here to leave an HONEST review, as they‚Äôre censoring their reviews.

I went to place an order on my asos app and a message came up that my account is blocked so I contacted customer service and they told me that my account was closed due to me returning more then I keep , I get it in some ways but when you order multiple sizes of one item you are bound to return more then you keep. 
When I asked the customer service person what I can do I was told very abruptly that the decision is fine. In this day and age where there are some many competitors all trying to get your business I would think that ASOS would be going out of their way to keep their customers, they are obviously making too much money!!

My account has been closed with no notification and when  l have tried to contact so called 'customer services' the assistant refused to discuss, resend the unreceived email or allow me to raise a complaint then proceeded to cut off the chat! I am assuming that my account has been closed due to a large number of returns; l own this. I am very tall (female, 6'2"") and am also plus sized so finding clothes to fit is nigh on impossible! Tops and dresses are almost always too short/don't fit well but l do buy all of my trousers from Asos (having said that, even some of their tall trousers come up short or badly fitting!). Having been a customer for years and years, l accepted the introduction of the Fair Use Policy and have been trying really hard to reduce my order frequency and number of items in each order then have begrudgingly paid for recent returns because l accept my returns percentage is on the high side (having said that, l did keep 3 pairs of trousers from my most recent order!); l just don't think this is entirely my fault. It is a combination of my size, poor quality or poor fitting products and also the need to order for choice! It is gutting that Asos have a blanket policy which doesn't take account personal challenges but it is even more disgusting the fact l have not been warned of the account closure and the 'customer service' assistant was so rude he would not discuss or further my complaint. I am incredibly disappointed in Asos as a company and hope they re-think decisions that affect loyal customers and are being made in haste/are actually sizest and prejudice!

This company have gone completely down hill, in terms of quality and care. 
I was sent two incorrect items in my last order yet have ended up out of pocket, spent hours trying to get some assistance and  continuously been cut off by the chat system. 
Despite the temptation of being able to buy multiple brands in one place I won‚Äôt be ordering from ASOS again after this last experience. It is simply getting worse and worse and the refund process is now complete pot luck as to whether things are correctly administered or what amount of money you get back. 
Particularly frustrating when you are returning something because they sent you the wrong item in the first place.

I asked if I could return the incorrect item along with a sealed makeup item I had only added to qualify for free delivery. I was clearly told that I could return both items in one parcel and that I would not be charged for doing so. I have written evidence of this. ASOS refunded the wrong item, and it was out of stock so couldn‚Äôt have a replacement. Then later deducted the return fee claiming I no longer qualified for free returns since the threshold was not met. This is unfair, the return was caused by their own error. They have refused to honour the promise made by their staff and have closed the complaint telling me not to contact them despite my evidence. This is a clear case of misleading customer service and unfair return deductions, in breach of consumer law. I will be reporting the issue to Citizens Advice and Trading Standards.

If ASOS makes a mistake with your order, be very cautious, as you may end up paying for it ‚Äî literally.
