68b606e391ed49673f0595ae,"I’m reviewing to express my deep dissatisfaction with a recent experience involving a return and refund request for a pair of trousers I ordered from ASOS

Upon receiving the trousers, it was immediately clear that they were see-through. I did not try them on or wear them, and I returned them in the same condition. To my surprise, my refund was declined on the grounds that the item had been worn. I was then sent the trousers back, and upon inspection, it was obvious that they had in fact been worn, but not by me. This leads me to believe the item I was originally sent had already been worn and returned by someone else, which is incredibly unhygienic and unacceptable.

I contacted customer service to explain the situation, but was initially dismissed. After pushing further, a supervisor eventually agreed to a refund and advised me to dispose of the trousers — but before I could save the conversation, the chat system disconnected. I received no confirmation email about the refund.

As a result, I had to re-enter the chat and repeat the entire story, which left me feeling frustrated and anxious. Eventually, I was referred to a manager, who unfortunately was quite dismissive and unsympathetic. Although the manager initially confirmed the refund, the chat was abruptly ended after I provided feedback,  and I was again informed that the refund had been declined.

This entire experience has been incredibly disappointing. The fact that I received what appears to be a used item in the first place raises serious concerns about your quality control processes. On top of that, the lack of a proper escalation or email support system, combined with inconsistent and unsupportive customer service, made me feel like I was pleading for fairness — despite being completely honest and reasonable in my request.

After this experience, I cannot see myself shopping with ASOS again. I hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made both in their returns inspection processes and in the quality of their customer service.

after this experience, i cannot see myself shopping with asos again. i hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made both in their returns inspection processes and in the quality of their customer service.

Looking at the app and the return order status is still RETURN SENT instead of REFUND SENT. Clearly procedural issues happening at the warehouse which Customer care are refusing to help with. They need to bring the Customer care team back to the UK where the advisors actually understand the issue and know how to help. Cheap outsourcing is going to cost ASOS in the long run.

Looking forward to issuing a chargeback with my card provider so that I can close my ASOS account after shopping with them since 2010.

⭐ (1/5 stars)

I am beyond frustrated with ASOS and their complete failure to deliver both products and customer service. This has been hands down the worst online shopping experience I've ever encountered.

**The Delivery Nightmare:**
Their delivery company claimed THREE separate delivery attempts with ""no access"" to my property. This is completely fabricated. I live in a standard house - not an apartment building, no gates, no construction, nothing blocking access. I was home ALL DAY on each supposed delivery attempt, watching for the delivery. No one came. No delivery attempts were made. No cards were left. Nothing.

**Customer Service That Doesn't Exist:**
When I contacted ASOS about this obvious lie from their delivery partner, their customer service was absolutely useless. Despite requesting to speak with a live agent multiple times, I received nothing but the same copy-and-paste responses over and over again. They clearly don't read messages or care about resolving issues - just robotic, scripted responses that completely ignore the actual problem.

**The Delivery Company is Unreachable:**
The delivery company provides zero ways to contact them. No phone number, no email, and even their AI chat assistant is completely non-functional. How is this acceptable in 2025? When there's clearly an issue with delivery, customers should have some recourse.

**Complete Lack of Accountability:**
ASOS takes no responsibility for their chosen delivery partners' failures. They hide behind ""delivery partner policies"" while taking your money and failing to deliver the service you paid for.

I've wasted hours trying to resolve this simple delivery issue, only to be met with lies, automated responses, and complete indifference. My order is now in limbo, I'm out the money, and ASOS couldn't care less.

Save yourself the headache and shop literally anywhere else. ASOS has clearly given up on customer service entirely. There are plenty of other online retailers who actually care about getting your purchases to you and resolving issues when they arise.

68b470d949e122dc24ecbe09,"I have now had at least 8 chats and email conversations with ASOS customer service about the same issue. The problem started with technical errors on the website during payment: for example, I select iDeal, but I get redirected to a PayPal page. After that, I receive an error message, the items appear as ordered, but then they get cancelled automatically.

Instead of acknowledging this as a technical issue on the ASOS website, I was taken through long troubleshooting steps that led nowhere, with vague advice like “contact your bank.” That makes no sense – what does my bank have to do with being redirected from iDeal to PayPal? This is clearly a fault on ASOS’s side.

This problem has occurred repeatedly, I have given feedback multiple times, yet nothing is solved. The website is misleading because it promises one payment method but forces another, and then cancels the order. Meanwhile, ASOS refuses to provide me with the legally required contact details of the legal disputes/complaints team, despite me asking for them in every conversation. Instead, I am told to wait 24–48 hours for a manager – which is not a lawful substitute.

According to the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU, Article 6) and the UK Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, ASOS is required to provide consumers with clear and accessible information and to refrain from misleading or unfair practices. ASOS is failing on both points.

I therefore expect:
	•	Compensation for the time I wasted because of ASOS’s misleading website and repeated failed orders.
	•	Immediate shipment of my cancelled items or a proper replacement solution.
	•	The direct contact details of the legal disputes/complaints team, as required by law.

68ada02042394759f6421230,"Shocking sub-standard online 'customer care'! I only gave this 1 star because there is no option for 0 stars.

I ordered a product as a gift and paid for premium next-day delivery on 23rd for a birthday on the 24th.

The delivery window is stated as 7am - 10pm

At 21:45 I used the DPD tracking service and could see the parcel was at one of their warehouses - more than a hour's drive away.

I contacted ASOS online and that's when the fun started: In summary I was told:
1. Wait until the end of the day/night - notwithstanding the delivery window is until 10pm. I emphasised this to three support agents over the span of a couple hours. They clearly seemed to be unable to comprehend the fact that the order was already late.

2. I should always allow a couple extra days for delivery delays - why on earth does ASOS offer, and take money, for guaranteed next-day delivery if they are not confident it can happen. NOTE - my frustration  has nothing to do with the £7 premium delivery fee! This was offered as a refund but my issue with the absolute ineptitude of the 'customer support' - not the delivery fee refund!

3. The issue is with the carrier not ASOS....CORRECTION, I contracted with, and paid ASOS. ASOS appoints logistics service providers to fulfill their comittments. The responsibility rests with ASOS to ensure service standards are maintained. It is NOT my responsibility to chase 3rd party service providers.

4. One of the agents (Emily) 'exited the chat' when I kept emphasising that the delivery was already late, after being told to wait another day.

5. When I logged on to the DPD chat bot facility the response was to get ASOS to raise a 'parcel search' (as it may be displaced in the warehouse). I requested this of the last agent I engaged with. He told me that he had contacted DPD and was told that it would be delivered the next day. When I asked HOW he contacted them he couldn't tell me - he blatantly lied!

The strategy that the agents adopted was to defer the conversation by telling the customer to be patient and wait another day so that they did not have to deal with the matter properly.

Instead of telling me to be patient, wait another day and then raise a concern, plan ahead better etc etc all one of them needed to say was 'we are terribly sorry about the inconvenience and your frustration. I have attempted to contact DPD with no response but I will continue trying to do so and will contact you with an update when I receive one' but no, make it the customer's issue and defer the problem so that they don't need to deal with it.

68a7e8c74add715f930b1793,"A Warning for Shoppers: Dealing with Faulty Goods from ASOS Partner Brands

I recently purchased a pair of New Balance 327 trainers in black from ASOS. While initially very happy with their comfort, I was soon disappointed when they developed a loud, squeaking noise after just a few days of wear. The sound was extremely conspicuous, drawing unwanted attention and making me feel too self-conscious to wear them.

Attempting to resolve this, I contacted ASOS customer service. I was informed that, as it was a 'partner item', I would have to contact New Balance directly to arrange a return. Upon contacting New Balance, I was told the opposite—that I needed to go through ASOS, as they were the retailer. This frustrating cycle is a common tactic where neither party seems willing to take responsibility after they have made a sale.

After persistent effort, I finally managed to speak to a human at ASOS who was very helpful and promised to email a returns label within three days. The label never arrived. As a non-UK resident with a scheduled flight, I was forced to leave the country with the faulty shoes, unable to return them in time.

Now based in Thailand, I contacted ASOS again. Their response was is that had 28 days from the purchase date to return the item, ignoring my specific query about an international return. When I investigated shipping from Thailand myself, I was quoted a minimum of £75, with no guarantee the return would be processed in time.

My case is still ongoing, but I share this experience to advise others who might face a similar problem.",1,A Warning for Shoppers,0,2025-08-22 05:49:27+00:00,Malvin Chiponda,4,TH,"a warning for shoppers: dealing with faulty goods from asos partner brands

68a71d5370457ad9141ec735,"I ordered the Mango Classic Gold Oval Buckle Belt in Black from ASOS. When I clicked the size guide, it only showed S/M/L with no actual measurements — no cm or inch info at all.

I’m a UK size 12, so I went with M (as I normally would), but the belt was way too big. This kind of vague sizing info is really unhelpful — especially for accessories like belts where fit actually matters.

Because I am going to return it and won't be able to keep over £40 worth of items (my total order was £44), so I am going to be charged a £3.95 return fee for your mistake?

Trying on clothes at home — especially with online sizing — is not abuse. It's a normal and necessary part of online fashion shopping.

ASOS doesn’t have physical stores, so people have to order multiple sizes or styles just to find one that fits. Penalizing returns assumes that all returns are bad — when in fact, the problem is their own sizing inconsistency and lack of product detail.

They punish customers for returning things that don’t work and shift the blames on customers instead of relfect their flaws. That’s not a “Fair Use” issue — that’s bad service being rebranded as “customer misuse.”

To make it worse, when I reached out to customer service for help, the agent ended the chat while I was still typing.

Every order has a faulty or incorrect item, and as countless other replies noted, customer service is literally like TALKING TO A WALL. Honestly, ChatGPT has better people skills than these ‘human agents.’
Recently, I made a combined return of multiple orders. I got a return label instructing me to send everything back by 10th August, which I did.

This is misleading, unfair, and unlawful, as I followed the exact instructions ASOS gave me.
Customer service? A nightmare. Cut off repeatedly, bounced between agents, escalated to “managers” — but talking to even higher-level people in chat is like talking to yourself. They refuse to acknowledge what you’re asking or repeatedly saying. One “manager” even refused to confirm he was a real person, just kept repeating, “I’m Rahul, here to help you.” It is ridiculous. At this point, I'm suspicious they completely shut their customer service department and they are scamming us with ai lol.

689e9ea28c0c1c7211b4793d,"This experience has been awful. I ordered $685 worth or apparel from glasses and accessories to button up shirts, a suit, pants and summer tops. I place that order on July 24th. Immediately they told me the glasses i ordered were no longer available. The estimated delivery date on my emails and the APP and site stated August 1 for the remaining orders. The delivery didn't come and I waited 3 days after and started to contact ASOS about my order. I have been on the chat over seven times between August 1st and now. The carrier never updated the tracking and I have no idea where the order is. ASOS said they would open an investigation with the carrier and give them 2 days to reply. I waited 3 days and reached back out and forced them to give me an update. The day after I reached out again to learn the investigation on the carrier states that the package is still in transit and should be delivered to the USPS soon. I replied back to that email with questions as they requested and didn't hear back from them at all in 2 days. I went back to the chat for the 6th time. While explaining yet again the network error occurred and closed the chat. I went back in and asked for a manager because at this point I've been waiting for nearly a month for an order which is late by 14 days and has an open investigation into the carrier with no reply from ASOS on the email and no updated tracking information still. I reitterate this all to the chat and instead of getting the manager she tried to handle the situation and failed. At this point i asked for a full refund. She said they can't provide a refund since it is still in transit and may still arrive. I replied get me a manager and refund me fully immediately as your supply chain and shipping issues are not my problem.

i ordered 3 bikinis from asos as of late and had issues with all three. each time i’ve been on the chat i’ve spent over an hour (one being an hour and a half!!!!) speaking to these incompetent slow and careless “advisors”. the chat has terrible connection, it’s constantly reloading and disconnecting causing you to have to start again after spending 40 minutes talking to some lost employee. one of them just exited the chat (???) after i’ve gone over everything and waited 35 minutes for him to sort it. he asked me to hold on a second and then just closed the chat? 

just now i’ve spent an hour and a half speaking to the delightful and helpful robin jerick who when didn’t know what he was talking and then just closed the chat on me. apparently when needing to return a used item back to asos due to poor quality you’re just mean to send it back to the warehouse and maybe they’ll accept it (again… ???) he left me with no solution and an hour and a half of my time wasted. i’m livid. so disrespectful and so frustrated. i’m tired of asos and their bs. their crap clothing and bikinis that are ruined after 1 use (the audacity to charge the money they do!), terrible and dated chat and dim witted advisors.

I contacted ASOS customer service and was told an “investigation” had been raised — fine, I waited the two days they asked for. Nothing happened. No email. No follow-up. No resolution. So I reached out again, and guess what? They hadn’t even raised the investigation properly. Their solution? Start the clock again and ask me to wait another two working days.

When I said enough is enough and asked for my money back, they flat-out refused. I spoke to two different agents and a “manager” — none of whom had the authority to refund me, apparently. I’m now being told to wait indefinitely for an invisible “escalations team” who don’t speak to customers and have no defined response time. Total joke.

I’ve paid for a product I never received, and ASOS is just shrugging and stalling. This isn’t just bad service — it’s bordering on fraudulent. They’ve taken my money, failed to deliver, and are refusing to give it back.

I ordered something at ASOS. The delivery company did not deliver it to my address, and the package was lost for a long time. In the meantime, I spoke with ASOS, and they said they would start an investigation and get me my money back. For a while, I never heard from them again. About a month later, I eventually received the package from someone who said she was the realtor from one of the vacant apartments, and she found it on the balcony of this house. The delivery company just threw the package on the balcony instead of delivering it to my house.

Before I could even speak to someone at customer care, the chat started over again three times. All these times, I was in the middle of a conversation. The last time I finally had a conversation, which eventually lasted 1,5 hours because they replied in bad English and very slowly, which resulted in the answer: ""We can not help you any further because the time window of the return policy had been surpassed"". I said that the time window does not apply in a situation where you did not receive the package in time, but the only answer I got, multiple times, was that they couldn't help me any further. 

At this point, I am stuck with a package filled with clothes that I sadly do not fit, or are of poor quality, and I will not get my money back, even though I am not at fault in this situation.

68893b593046cfba839bab59,"Like many others, ASOS cancelled my account due to “too many returns”. Instead of just doing what most other brands now do — charging a return fee (which I’d be happy to pay to have access to their store, as I’m severely disabled by a chronic illness so can’t access shops in person) — they’ve come up with this absolutely bizarre solution. Their sizing and quality is all over the place as well, hence why customers have to return so many items or order multiple sizes because you never know what to expect. It’s a non-inclusive approach that blocks people with different sizing needs or access restrictions from shopping with them.

Also shady, several items I’ve bought from them have been listed as “100% cotton” on their website but are actually completely made of plastic when they arrive. This seems shady to me during a movement towards more planet-friendly fashion. When this happened most recently, I tried to leave a review demonstrating it and included a photo of the composition label, and ASOS rejected my review. When I re-opened the review to edit it and re-submit, there was no button to press submit, despite them saying I could re-submit in their email. How convenient for them.

ASOS refunded the wrong item, and it was out of stock so couldn’t have a replacement. Then later deducted the return fee claiming I no longer qualified for free returns since the threshold was not met. This is unfair, the return was caused by their own error. They have refused to honour the promise made by their staff and have closed the complaint telling me not to contact them despite my evidence.
